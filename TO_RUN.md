To run the application, you have credentials, which are properly hidden in a ".env" file, as follows:
- Flask secret key
- mongoDB password.

I recommend that you manually enter your own credentials in both cases, so change the secret password at your discretion, and create a database (with your credentials) to use in the program.

If you want to test it, the application is online at:
